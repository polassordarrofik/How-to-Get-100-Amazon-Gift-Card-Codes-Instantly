One of the best ways to maximize savings is by purchasing discounted Amazon gift cards. Websites like Raise, CardCash, and Gift Card Granny offer gift cards at lower prices than their face value. Keep an eye out for discounts, which can range from 2% to 10% or more, depending on availability.

2. Earn Free Amazon Gift Cards

There are multiple ways to earn free Amazon gift cards without spending a dime:

Survey Websites: Sign up for survey platforms like Swagbucks, InboxDollars, and Survey Junkie to earn points that can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards.

Cashback Apps: Use apps like Rakuten, Ibotta, and Fetch Rewards to accumulate cashback on purchases that can be converted into Amazon gift cards.

Amazon Trade-In Program: Trade in old electronics, books, and other eligible items in exchange for Amazon gift cards.

Microsoft Rewards: Earn points for using Bing search and redeem them for Amazon gift cards.

Referral Bonuses: Many websites and apps offer Amazon gift cards as referral incentives when you invite friends and family.

3. Use Amazon Reload for Bonus Credits

Amazon sometimes offers promotional bonuses when you reload your gift card balance. For instance, first-time reloaders might receive a small bonus (e.g., $10 for adding $100). Keep an eye on Amazon’s promotional offers page to see if you qualify.

4. Stack Amazon Gift Cards with Cashback and Coupons

Maximize savings by combining Amazon gift cards with:

Cashback Credit Cards: Use a credit card that offers cashback or rewards on purchases to buy Amazon gift cards.

Amazon Coupons: Browse the “Coupons” section on Amazon to find discounts on everyday products.

Subscribe & Save: For repeat purchases, Amazon’s Subscribe & Save program offers up to 15% off eligible items.

5. Take Advantage of Amazon Promotions

Amazon frequently offers promotions where you can earn additional credits for using gift cards. Some common promotions include:

Buy an Amazon Gift Card, Get a Bonus: Amazon occasionally offers $5 to $15 in promotional credit when you buy a certain amount in gift cards.

Reload Gift Card Balance for a Bonus: Check if Amazon is offering reload bonuses for adding funds to your balance.

6. Use Amazon Gift Cards for Subscription Services

If you subscribe to services like Amazon Prime, Audible, Kindle Unlimited, or Amazon Music, consider using your gift card balance to pay for them. This can help you avoid unnecessary credit card charges while using earned or discounted gift cards.

7. Exchange Unwanted Gift Cards for Amazon Gift Cards

If you have gift cards from stores you rarely shop at, consider exchanging them for Amazon gift cards. Websites like CardCash, Gift Card Granny, and Raise allow you to trade or sell unwanted gift cards at competitive rates.

8. Buy Amazon Gift Cards with Discounted Gift Cards

Some retailers sell Amazon gift cards, and if you have a discounted gift card from that store, you can use it to buy an Amazon gift card at a lower effective cost. For example, if you buy a Walmart gift card at a 10% discount and use it to buy an Amazon gift card, you’re saving money indirectly.

9. Utilize Amazon’s No-Rush Shipping Rewards

If you’re an Amazon Prime member, you can choose No-Rush Shipping at checkout to earn digital credits that can be used for Amazon purchases, including e-books, movies, and other digital content.

10. Use Amazon Gift Cards During Sales and Prime Day

Amazon hosts major sales events like Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday. Save up your Amazon gift cards and use them strategically during these events to maximize discounts and get the best deals.

11. Buy Amazon Gift Cards for Budgeting

If you want to control your spending on Amazon, consider loading a set amount onto an Amazon gift card each month. This way, you can shop without overspending while making use of any available discounts or rewards.

12. Check for Special Amazon Gift Card Offers from Banks and Retailers

Certain banks and retailers occasionally offer Amazon gift card promotions, such as extra rewards points or cashback for buying them. Always check your credit card’s offers or retailer promotions before purchasing gift cards.

13. Join Amazon Prime for Exclusive Gift Card Deals

Amazon Prime members often have access to exclusive gift card promotions. If you frequently shop on Amazon, the membership might be worth the investment, especially when considering other perks like free shipping and Prime Video access.

14. Combine Multiple Gift Cards into Your Amazon Balance

Instead of keeping track of multiple gift cards, add them to your Amazon balance. This prevents loss or expiration and allows you to easily use them at checkout.

15. Avoid Gift Card Scams

Always buy Amazon gift cards from reputable sources. Avoid third-party sellers that seem suspicious or offer unrealistic discounts, as they may be selling fraudulent cards.
